# Point-Of-Intersection
A simple C++ program that finds intersection of two lines.
The line must be given in the form of two points.

Example:
The line AB is given by points (1,1) and (4,4).
The line CD is given by points (1,8) and (2,4).

The program finds the intersection of these two lines and returns
the intersection point (2.4, 2.4).
